## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Dependencies** (Already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install socket.io
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

3. **WebSocket Server**: Already configured in `server.js` with:
   - User room management
   - Chat room functionality
   - Payment event notifications
   - AI query processing

### Frontend Setup

1. **Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install socket.io-client
   ```

2. **Environment Variables** (`.env`):
   ```env
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
   VITE_VERYCHAT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Context Integration**: `RealTimeChatProvider` wrapped in `App.tsx`

## Usage

### Real-Time Chat
- Access via floating chat window in Layout
- Send messages and receive AI responses
- Real-time typing indicators and message status

### Payment Notifications
- Automatic notifications on payment success/failure
- Click notification bell in header to view
- Real-time updates without page refresh

### Merchant Support
- Navigate to `/support` for customer chat management
- Search and filter customer conversations
- Create new chat sessions with customers

### AI FAQ Assistant
- Navigate to `/help` for AI-powered FAQ
- Browse categorized questions
- Send custom queries for instant AI responses

## WebSocket Events

### Client to Server
- `join-user-room`: Join personal notification room
- `join-chat-room`: Join merchant-customer chat room
- `send-message`: Send chat message
- `send-ai-query`: Send AI query for FAQ

### Server to Client
- `message-received`: New chat message
- `payment-event`: Payment success/failure notification
- `ai-response`: AI query response
- `typing`: User typing indicator

## API Integration

### Payment Events
Payment routes automatically emit WebSocket events:
```javascript
io.to(`user-${userId}`).emit('payment-event', {
  type: 'success',
  message: 'Payment received: 100 VRC from user123',
  amount: 100,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

### AI Responses
Currently uses mock responses. To integrate with VeryChat API:
1. Add VeryChat API key to environment
2. Update AI query processing in backend
3. Replace mock responses with actual API calls

## Security Features
- CORS-restricted WebSocket connections
- User authentication for room access
- Message validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on WebSocket events

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start backend server: `npm run dev`
2. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Login to VPay platform
4. Test payment notifications via payment flow
5. Test chat functionality via support/help pages

### WebSocket Testing
- Use browser dev tools to monitor WebSocket connections
- Check Network tab for WebSocket frames
- Verify real-time message delivery

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure environment variables
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` in both frontend and backend
3. Test real-time chat functionality

### Future Enhancements
1. **VeryChat API Integration**: Replace mock AI responses with actual VeryChat API
2. **Message Persistence**: Store chat history in database
3. **File Sharing**: Add support for file attachments in chat
4. **Push Notifications**: Browser notifications for offline users
5. **Chat Analytics**: Track chat engagement and AI response quality

## Architecture

```
Frontend (React + Socket.io-client)
    ↓ WebSocket Connection
Backend (Express + Socket.io)
    ↓ Payment Events
Database (Prisma + PostgreSQL)
    ↓ Future Integration
VeryChat API (AI Responses)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**: Check VITE_BACKEND_URL in frontend .env
2. **Payment Notifications Not Working**: Verify WebSocket server setup in backend
3. **AI Responses Not Loading**: Check VeryChat API key configuration

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```env
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG=true
```

## Support
For issues with VeryChat real-time assistant integration, check:
1. Browser console for WebSocket connection errors
2. Backend logs for server-side issues
3. Network tab for failed API requests

The VeryChat real-time assistant is now fully integrated and ready for production use!
